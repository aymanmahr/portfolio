  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <section style="text-align: center;font-family: monospace;font-size: larger;">
  <p >
    Hey! , I’m  a passionate coder, competitive gamer, and budding entrepreneur.

    I started my journey with curiosity—breaking down games to see how they work, which led me into the world of programming. From building websites and automating tasks to working on game mechanics and security tools, I love turning ideas into reality through code.
    
    When I’m not writing code, you’ll probably find me in a speedrun, a gaming tournament, or sketching out my next startup idea. I’ve participated in hackathons, managed small projects, and I’m always looking to learn and grow.
    
    I believe that innovation lies where technology meets creativity, and I'm here to keep building cool things that make an impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    My love for gaming pushed me to learn coding so I could create my own games and apps, especially to record and share my gameplay. Over time, I began testing and reviewing games, not for the money, but because I truly enjoy discovering new ideas and mechanics.This journey naturally led me to the world of business, where I now combine my skills in development, gaming, and strategy to build meaningful projects. I'm also an avid reader and currently working on writing my first book.In the end, I fell in love with creating — not just for goals or deadlines, but for the fun of building something meaningful. And if you've got a challenge? Count me in.

    “Curious mind. Creative builder. Always up for a challenge.”
